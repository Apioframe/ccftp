# ccftp
Ftp for computercraft

# How to install:
Run `wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afonya2/ccftp/main/installer.lua`

If you want to start the ftp by default rename the `ftpserver.lua` to `startup.lua`

If you want to use the ftpserver while a console is running rename the `ftpservershell.lua` to `startup.lua`

# Warning:
Currently the encryption system does NOT work, so don't use a "secure" password

With a sniffer others can easily get your password
